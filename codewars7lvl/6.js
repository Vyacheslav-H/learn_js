// Puzzle
// If you don't know who Waldo is, he's a nice guy who likes to be in crowded places.
//  But he's also a bit odd as he always likes to hide in plain sight.
// Can you spot Waldo in the crowd?

// Task
// Given crowd, an array of strings of equal length, representing a crowded place,
// return an array with two integers representing the coordinates [y, x]
//  where Waldo can be found ([0, 0] is top-left, y being the row and x being the column ).

// Examples
// We've spotted Waldo a couple of times in the past. Below is what we found out.
// Note that he's been in much more crowded places lately.

// #1 Waldo at the beach
// "             "          Air
// "         w   "           Air with a bird
// "   w         "           Air with a bird
// "~~~~~~~~~~~~~"           Sea
// ".~..~~.~~~..~"           Waves on beach
// "...P......P.."           Beach with some people
// "......P..P..."           Beach with some people
// "..PW........."           Beach with Waldo and presumably a friend next to him

// Unredacted report: Waldo can be found at [7, 3], wearing his usual outfit

// #2 Waldo visiting the Great Pyramid
// "                              "          Air
// "                              "           Air
// "            _                 "           Top of pyramid
// "          _____               "           Layer of pyramid
// "        _________             "           Layer of pyramid
// "  B  _______________   G   GG "           Ground layer
//  of pyramid with several people, including Waldo

// Unredacted report: Waldo can be found at [5, 2],
//  wearing special clothes protecting him from the sun

// Hints
// - he isn't always wearing his usual clothes

// - why is there more than one bird in the first example ...
